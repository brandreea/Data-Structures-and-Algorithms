# DataStructureandAlgorithms# DataStructureandAlgorithms

This repository represent a collection of solved problems using data structures and algorithms.<br>
The problems are divided in cathegories, which are followed by a pdf with the tasks.<br>
Even though they are in romanian, the sources have comments in english to explain the tasks and/or bibliography guiding to _Algorithm Design_, leetcode.com, geeksforgeeks.com and other sources can be found in the pdfs.

The two main cathegories are:
## TAP
T.A.P. stands for advanced programming techniques (ro-"Tehnici avansate de programare").
This repository mainly consists of problems. 
The target chapters are:
1. Divide et Impera
2. Backtracking
3. Dynamic Programming
4. Greedy

## Algoritmica Grafurilor (Graph Theory)
This folder contains mostly implementations of classic algorithms divided in cathegories:
1. BFS and DFS
2. Havel Hakimi (Grpahic vertex degree sequences)
3. Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal&Prim)
4. Shortest Path Methods (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd- Warshall, topological sort)<br>
_Note: The sources in this folder are very similar to the ones on GeeksForGeeks. My attempt was to implement and understand the basic functionality._
